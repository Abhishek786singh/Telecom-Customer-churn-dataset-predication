# Telecom-Customer-churn-dataset-predication
Telecom-Customer-churn-dataset-predication ,Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company
The main contribution of our work is to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn. The model developed in this work uses machine learning techniques on big data platform and builds a new way of features' engineering and selection.

Churn is one of the largest problems facing most businesses. According to Harvard Business Review, it costs between 5 times and 25 times as much to find a new customer than to retain an existing one. In other words, your existing customers are worth their weight in gold!
Preventing customer churn is an important business function. It’s also one that has too often been approached with scattershot, back-of-the-envelope methods. By building a model to predict customer churn with machine learning algorithms, ideally we can nip the problem of unsatisfied customers in the bud — and keep the revenue flowing.
